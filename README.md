I made this because I wanted to learn to read binary faster for whatever reason, and I thougt "Y'know, I should put this on Github so other people can do the same!", and here we are now.
## Features
Pretty minimalistic, just a practice with intsant feedback, a score out of 20 at the end, and an average time to awnser.

## Build Instructions
To build your own .deb package, download the `Package` folder, then in the folder where the `Package` folder is stored, run `dpkg-deb --build Package`. You will get a Package.deb file in the directory that the `Package` folder was in, and you can then install it.
